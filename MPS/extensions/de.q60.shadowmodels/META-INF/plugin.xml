  <name>Shadow Models</name>
  <description>A shadow model is a non-editable model derived from existing models by model-to-model transformations. It is incrementally maintained while editing the input model. Transformations are described in a special language designed to support incremental updates of the output model. Dynamic dependency tracking is used during the executing of the transformations which removes the need for a declarative language. BaseLanguage expressions with all its extensions are supported inside the transformation rules. The transformation language is similar to the MPS generator language. It has transformation rules with a left side that describes the input it applies to and a right side that creates the output. The right side is similar to light quotations instead of using the concrete syntax of the target language.</description>
